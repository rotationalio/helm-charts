The Linode DNS01 ACME Solver Webhook has been successfully deployed and is available
to cert-manager at:

https://{{ include "acme-linode.fullname" . }}.{{ include "acme-linode.namespace" . }}.svc.cluster.local

{{ if .Values.secret.create -}}
A secret with your linode credentials has been created for API access to the DNS Manager.
{{ else -}}
If you haven't already, ensure that you create a secret with your linode access token
so that the webhook can access the DNS Manager via the API. This secret should have the
following properties:

name: {{ .Values.secret.name }}
namespace: {{ include "acme-linode.namespace" . }}
key: {{ .Values.secret.key }}
{{- end }}

You can now create issuers with the following solvers property:

solvers:
  - dns01:
    webhook:
      solverName: linode
      groupName: {{ .Values.groupName }}
